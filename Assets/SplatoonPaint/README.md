## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-  Unity ver. 2020.2 or higher

### Running the project

Right after the installation of this package, go to "Project Settings -> Quality" and then replace the URP Asset with the ones coming with this package, which has a "custom forward renderer" with "Render Metaball Screen Space" feature.

Or you can add a "Render Metaball Screen Space" feature to your current renderer instead.
